# Advent of Code
In 2023 I attempted the Advent of Code using Python. I am writing this on the second day, not sure if I will actually complete this or not.

My daughter came across it from her school where some of her classmates were trying it. I started doing it with her, got hooked on, and continued. I am doing these using Python, a language I don't know much of, but just figuring it out as we go. She was using Python as she's learning it.
